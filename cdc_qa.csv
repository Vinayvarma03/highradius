What is a novel coronavirus?,"A novel coronavirus is a is a coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease  (COVID-19). Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that target and affect mammals’ respiratory systems.There are four main ranks of coronaviruses: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma. A diagnosis with coronavirus 229E, NL63, OC43, or HKU1 is not the same as a COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients with COVID-19 will be evaluated and cared for differently than patients with common coronavirus diagnosis."
"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19.There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease was selected following the World Health Organization (WHO) best practiceexternal icon for naming of new human infectious diseases."
Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?,"People  may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.
"
How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?,"People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma.
"
What is the source of the virus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the Situation Summary: Source and Spread of the Virus.
"
How does the virus spread?,"This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now spreading from person-to-person. It's important to note that person-to-person spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like measles), while other viruses are less so.
The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (community spread) in some affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
Learn what is known about the spread of newly emerged coronaviruses.
"
Can someone who has had COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why MoHFW recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.
How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.
Current MoHFW guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following requirements:

The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.
The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.
The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.

Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of infection to others.
"
Can someone who has been quarantined for COVID-19 spread the illness to others?,"Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar coronaviruses. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.
"
"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including refrigerated or frozen food?","Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures."
Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?,Warm/Hot Weather Won’t Stop the Spread of COVID-19
What is community spread?,"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. Each health department determines community spread differently based on local conditions
"
What temperature kills the virus that causes COVID-19?,"A temperature of around 70°C (158°F) is effective at quickly killing SARS-CoV-2
"
Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the India?,"This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment may change daily. The latest updates are available on MoHFWs Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) website.
"
Has anyone in the India gotten infected?,"Yes. There have been cases of COVID-19 in the India. related to travel and through close contact. India. case counts are updated regularly Mondays through Fridays. See the current India. case count of COVID-19.
"
How can I help protect myself?,"Avoid touching surfaces, especially in public settings or health facilities, in case people infected with COVID-19 have touched them. Clean surfaces regularly with standard disinfectants. Frequently clean your hands with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub."
What should I do if I had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"There is information for people who have had close contact with a person confirmed to have, or being evaluated for, COVID-19 available online.
"
Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?,"Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes:
Older adults
People who have serious underlying medical conditions like:
Heart disease
Diabetes
Lung disease



"
What should people at higher risk of serious illness with COVID-19 do?,"The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow)."
Does MoHFW recommend the use of facemask to prevent COVID-19?,"This face cover is not recommended for either health workers or those working with or in contact with COVID 19 patients or are patients themselves as these categories of people are required to wear specified protective gear.
"
Am I at risk for COVID-19 from a package or products shipping from China?," Two other coronaviruses have already emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV). The virus that causes COVID-19 is more genetically related to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don't know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in India"
Is it okay for me to donate blood?,"In healthcare settings all across the India, donated blood is a lifesaving, essential part of caring for patients. The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. MoHFW encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19. MoHFW is supporting blood centers by providing recommendations that will keep donors and staff safe. Examples of these recommendations include spacing donor chairs 6 feet apart, thoroughly adhering to environmental cleaning practices, and encouraging donors to make donation appointments ahead of time.
"
What is the risk of my child becoming sick with COVID-19?,"Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. You can learn more about who is most at risk for health problems if they have COVID-19 infection on MoHFWs current Risk Assessment page.
"
How can I protect my child from COVID-19 infection?,"You can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.

Clean hands often using soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer
Avoid people who are sick (coughing and sneezing)
Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, sinks)
Launder items including washable plush toys as appropriate in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. If possible, launder items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from an ill person can be washed with other peopleâ€™s items.

You can find additional information on preventing COVID-19 at Prevention for 2019 Novel Coronavirus and at Preventing COVID-19 Spread in Communities. Additional information on how COVID-19 is spread is available at How COVID-19 Spreads.
"
Are the symptoms of COVID-19 different in children than in adults?,"No. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar in children and adults. However, children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Reported symptoms in children include cold-like symptoms, such as fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported. Itâ€™s not known yet whether some children may be at higher risk for severe illness, for example, children with underlying medical conditions and special healthcare needs. There is much more to be learned about how the disease impacts children.
"
Should children wear masks?,"No. If your child is healthy, there is no need for them to wear a facemask. Only people who have symptoms of illness or who are providing care to those who are ill should wear masks.
"
How can my family and I prepare for COVID-19?,"Create a household plan of action to help protect your health and the health of those you care about in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community:

Talk with the people who need to be included in your plan, and discuss what to do if a COVID-19 outbreak occurs in your community.
Plan ways to care for those who might be at greater risk for serious complications, particularly older adults and those with severe chronic medicalÂ conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease.

Make sure they have access to several weeks of medications and supplies in case you need to stay home for prolonged periods of time.


Get to know your neighbors and find out if your neighborhood has a website or social media page to stay connected.
Create a list of local organizations that you and your household can contact in the event you need access to information, healthcare services, support, and resources.
Create an emergency contact list of family, friends, neighbors, carpool drivers, health care providers, teachers, employers, the local public health department, and other community resources.

"
What steps can my family take to reduce our risk of getting COVID-19?,"Practice everyday preventive actions to help reduce your risk of getting sick and remind everyone in your home to do the same. These actions are especially important for older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.
Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue in the trash.
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects
(e.g., tables, countertops, light switches, doorknobs, and cabinet handles).

"
What should I do if someone in my house gets sick with COVID-19?,"Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. MoHFW has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including:

Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care.

When to Seek Medical AttentionIf you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. Emergency warning signs include*:

Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
New confusion or inability to arouse
Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning.



Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible).
Clean hands regularly by handwashing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others.
Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.
Avoid sharing personal items like utensils, food, and drinks.

"
"How can I prepare in case my childâ€™s school, child care facility, or university is dismissed?","Talk to the school or facility about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a college or university, encourage them to learn about the schoolâ€™s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.
"
How can I prepare for COVID-19 at work?,"Plan for potential changes at your workplace. Talk to your employer about their emergency operations plan, including sick-leave policies and telework options. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
"
Should I use soap and water or a hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?,"Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
"
What cleaning products should I use to protect against COVID-19?,"Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks. If surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection. To disinfect, most common EPA-registered household disinfectants will work. See MoHFWs recommendations for household cleaning and disinfection.
"
What should I do if there is an outbreak in my community?,"During an outbreak, stay calm and put your preparedness plan to work. Follow the steps below:
Protect yourself and others.

Stay home if you are sick. Keep away from people who are sick. Limit close contact with others as much as possible (about 6 feet).

Put your household plan into action. 

Stay informed about the local COVID-19 situation. Be aware of temporary school dismissals in your area, as this may affect your householdâ€™s daily routine.


Continue practicing everyday preventive actions. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.
Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes. Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childâ€™s school is dismissed temporarily. Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.
Stay in touch with others by phone or email. If you have a chronic medical condition and live alone, ask family, friends, and health care providers to check on you during an outbreak. Stay in touch with family and friends, especially those at increased risk of developing severe illness, such as older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions.

"
How do I prepare my children in case of COVID-19 outbreak in our community?,"Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild. Children respond differently to stressful situations than adults.
"
What steps should parents take to protect children during a community outbreak?,"This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your childâ€™s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.
If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.
Discourage children and teens from gathering in other public places while school is dismissed to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in the community.
"
Will schools be dismissed if there is an outbreak in my community?,"Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your childâ€™s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friendâ€™s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.
"
Should I go to work if there is an outbreak in my community?,"Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your childâ€™s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.
"
What are the symptoms and complications that COVID-19 can cause?,"Current symptoms reported for patients with COVID-19 have included mild to severe respiratory illness with fever1, cough, and difficulty breathing. Read about COVID-19 Symptoms.
"
Should I be tested for COVID-19?,"Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. For information about testing, see Testing for COVID-19.
"
Where can I get tested for COVID-19?,"The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from MoHFW while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested. See Testing for COVID-19 for more information.
"
Can a person test negative and later test positive for COVID-19?,"Using the MoHFW-developed diagnostic test, a negative result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the person's sample. In the early stages of infection, it is possible the virus will not be detected.For COVID-19, a negative test result for a sample collected while a person has symptoms likely means that the COVID-19 virus is not causing their current illness.
"
Why might someone blame or avoid individuals and groups (create stigma) because of COVID-19?,"People in the India. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading. Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in quarantine.
Stigma is discrimination against an identifiable group of people, a place, or a nation. Stigma is associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.
Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.
"
How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?,"People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support. Counter stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not target specific racial or ethnic groups and how COVID-19 actually spreads can help stop stigma.
"
Who is at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. 
Based upon available information to date, those at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 include: 

People aged 65 years and older
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
Other high-risk conditions could include:

People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have heart disease with complications
People who are immunocompromised including cancer treatment
People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)â‰¥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk


People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk

"
How were the underlying conditions selected?,"This list is based on:

What we are learning from the outbreak in other countries and in the India.
What we know about risk from other respiratory infections, like flu.

As MoHFW gets more information about COVID-19 cases here in India, we will update this list as needed.
"
What about underlying medical conditions that are not included on this list?,"Based on available information, adults aged 65 years and older and people of any age with underlying medical conditions included on this list are at higher risk for severe illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.MoHFW is collecting and analyzing data regularly and will update the list when we learn more. People with underlying medical conditions not on the list might also be at higher risk and should consult with their healthcare provider if they are concerned.
We encourage all people, regardless of risk, to:

Take steps to protect yourself and others.
Call your healthcare provider if you are sick with a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
Follow MoHFW travel guidelines and the recommendations of your state and local health officials.

"
What does well controlled mean?,"Generally, well-controlled means that your condition is stable, not life-threatening, and laboratory assessments and other findings are as similar as possible to those without the health condition. You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
"
What does more severe illness mean?,"Severity typically means how much impact the illness or condition has on your bodyâ€™s function.Â  You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
"
Are people with disabilities at higher risk?,"Most people with disabilities are not inherently at higher risk for becoming infected with or having severe illness from COVID-19.Â  Some people with physical limitations or other disabilities might be at a higher risk of infection because of their underlying medical condition.
Â 
People with certain disabilities might experience higher rates of chronic health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness and poorer outcomes from COVID-19.

Adults with disabilities are three times more likely to have heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer than adults without disabilities.

You should talk with your healthcare provider if you have a question about your health or how your health condition is being managed.
"
What should healthcare professionals and health departments do?,"For recommendations and guidance on persons under investigation; infection control, including personal protective equipment guidance; home care and isolation; and case investigation, see Information for Healthcare Professionals. For information on specimen collection and shipment, see Information for Laboratories. For information for public health professional on COVID-19, see Information for Public Health Professionals.
"
Am I at risk if I go to a funeral or visitation service for someone who died of COVID-19?,"There is currently no known risk associated with being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who died of COVID-19.
"
Am I at risk if I touch someone who died of COVID-19 after they have passed away?,"COVID-19 is a new disease andÂ we are still learning how it spreads. The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to mainly spread from close contact (i.e., within about 6 feet) with a person who is currently sick with COVID-19. The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Â This type of spread is not a concern after death.
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask).
Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturerâ€™s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. After removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
"
What do Funeral Home Workers need to know about handling decedents who had COVID-19?,"A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow Standard Precautions, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconÂ expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.
Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and facemask). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the MoHFWâ€™s Postmortem Guidance. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal iconÂ are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.).
After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.
Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases.
"
What should I do if my family member died from COVID-19 while overseas?,"When a US citizen dies outside the India, the deceased personâ€™s next of kin or legal representative should notify US consular officials at the Department of State. Consular personnel are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to provide assistance to US citizens for overseas emergencies. If a family member, domestic partner, or legal representative is in a different country from the deceased person, he or she should call the Department of Stateâ€™s Office of Overseas Citizens Services in Washington, DC, from 8 am to 5 pm Eastern time, Monday through Friday, at 888-407-4747 (toll-free) or 202-501-4444. For emergency assistance after working hours or on weekends and holidays, call the Department of State switchboard at 202-647-4000 and ask to speak with the Overseas Citizens Services duty officer. In addition, the US embassyexternal icon closest to or in the country where the US citizen died can provide assistance.
"
My family member died from COVID-19 while overseas. What are the requirements for returning the body to the India?,"MoHFW does not require an autopsy before the remains of a person who died overseas are returned to the India. Depending on the circumstances surrounding the death, some countries may require an autopsy. Sources of support to the family include the local consulate or embassy, travel insurance provider, tour operator, faith-based and aid organizations, and the deceasedâ€™s employer. There likely will need to be an official identification of the body and official documents issued by the consular office.
MoHFW requirements for importing human remains depend upon if the body has been embalmed, cremated, or if the person died from a quarantinable communicable disease.
At this time, COVID-19 is a quarantinable communicable disease in the India and the remains must meet the standards for importation found inÂ 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 71.55Â and may be cleared, released, and authorized for entry into the India only under the following conditions:

The remains are cremated; OR
The remains are properly embalmed and placed in a hermetically sealed casket; OR
The remains are accompanied by a permit issued by the MoHFW Director. The MoHFW permit (if applicable) must accompany the human remains at all times during shipment.

"
What is MoHFW doing about COVID-19?,"This is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation and MoHFW will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. MoHFW works 24/7 to protect peopleâ€™s health. More information about MoHFWâ€™s response to COVID-19Â is available online.
"
Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?,"There is no reason at this time to think that any animals, including pets, in the India might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. To date, MoHFW has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 in the India.
Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.
However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, itâ€™s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. For more information on the many benefits of pet ownership, as well as staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, livestock, and wildlife, visit MoHFWâ€™s Healthy Pets, Healthy People website.
"
Do I need to get my pet tested for COVID-19?,"No. At this time, routine testing of animals for COVID-19 is not recommended.
"
Can animals carry the virus that causes COVID-19 on their skin or fur?,"At this time, there is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of pets.
Talk to your veterinarian about the best ways to care for your pet.
"
Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?,"You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the new coronavirus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.
"
Are pets from a shelter safe to adopt?,"There is no reason to think that any animals, including shelter pets, in the India might be a source of COVID-19. 
"
What about imported animals or animal products?,"MoHFW does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the India. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. The India. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (MoHFW), the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the India. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) play distinct but complementary roles in regulating the importation of live animals and animal products into the India. MoHFW regulatesÂ animals and animal products that pose a threat to human health,Â USDA regulatesexternal iconÂ animals and animal products that pose a threat to agriculture; andÂ FWS regulatesexternal icon importation of endangered species and wildlife that can harm the health and welfare of humans, the interests of agriculture, horticulture, or forestry, and the welfare and survival of wildlife resources.
"
Can I travel to the India with dogs or import dogs into the India during the COVID-19 outbreak?,"Please refer to MoHFWâ€™s requirementsÂ for bringing a dog to the India. The currentÂ requirements for rabies vaccination apply to dogs imported from China, a high-risk country for rabies.
"
"What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the India (for example, by shelters, rescues, or as personal pets)?","Imported animals will need to meet MoHFW and USDAexternal iconÂ requirements for entering the India. At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinicÂ beforeÂ bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.
This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.
"
Can pets catch the cold?,"Yes they can. The viruses that cause a cold include rhinoviruses (up to 80%), coronaviruses and influenza (together accounting for much of the remaining 20%) and a small percentage of adenoviruses. When discussing cross species transfer, influenza is the most important to discuss as it is a fairly common cause of the ""common cold""."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection."
Are there treatments for COVID-19?,"Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness. Read our dexamethasone Q&A for more information.Results from the WHO’s Solidarity Trial indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to offer any benefit for treatment of COVID-19. Read our hydroxychloroquine Q&A for more information.WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and will continue to provide new information as it becomes available."
What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?,"If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health.If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility.If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation, wear a medical mask while travelling to and from the facility and during medical care. Also keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands.  This applies to adults and children."
How long does it take to develop symptoms?,"The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available."
What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19?,"If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may become infected, even if you feel well.

After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following:

Call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test.
Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus.
If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days.
While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.
Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.
Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.
Clean your hands frequently.
Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.
Keep the room well-ventilated.
If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.
Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days. 
Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home."
What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?,"Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Quarantine is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days.

Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test positive."
What about rapid tests?,"Rapid antigen tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test – RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious."
What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?,"In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by amplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels. For this reason, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin"
When should I get a test for COVID-19?,"Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.  

While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ residences or long-term care facilities."
How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?,"Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!"
Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?,"Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.

WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur.  These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care."
Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?,"People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness. 

However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age."
What happens to people who get COVID-19?,"Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.

Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.

In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection"
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are
